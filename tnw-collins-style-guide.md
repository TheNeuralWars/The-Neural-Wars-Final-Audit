# THE NEURAL WARS: COLLINS-INSPIRED STYLE GUIDE (ABRIDGED)

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- **Close POV:** Everything filtered through character senses/emotion.
- **Interiority:** Visceral, punchy reactions over analysis.
- **Dialogue:** Short, urgent, with action beats. Subtext over tags.
- **Concrete Sensation:** Replace abstractions with physical, multi-sensory detail.
- **Dynamic Pacing:** Short paragraphs for tension; vary sentence length.

---

## APPLICATION

- Highlight abstract terms; rewrite with sensory verbs/reactions.
- Break up long monologues/thoughts with physical cues.
- Dialogue: Limit to 15 words/line, interleave with actions, cut explanatory tags.
- Use one-word paragraphs for impact.

---

## LEXICON

- Swap overused terms for vivid alternatives (see lexicon in full guide).
- Each major character: unique speech, thought patterns, and metaphor.

---

## PRACTICAL CHECKLIST

- Each page: 3+ sensory details, no generic abstraction, tech filtered through POV.
- Each scene: Opens with hook, ends on tension/question.
- Each chapter: Emotional arc, sensory grounding, voice consistency.

---

**Apply for every scene to achieve gripping, immersive prose.**
