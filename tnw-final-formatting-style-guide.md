# THE NEURAL WARS SAGA — FINAL FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDE

---

## 1. **CHAPTER TITLES**

- Format:  
  `# [CHAPTER NUMBER]: [TITLE]`  
  Example:  
  `# 12: THE CHORUS OF I AM`
- All caps, bolded.  
- For print/ebook: Use a sci-fi font (e.g., Orbitron, Exo, or Roboto Mono) for chapter headings to reinforce the genre’s tone.
- Centered at the top of the chapter file.

---

## 2. **SCENE TAGS**

- Left-aligned, in brackets, on a line above each new scene, to signal tone/POV/scale and help pacing.
- Approved tags:  
  `[Action]` — High-stakes, kinetic scenes  
  `[Reflection]` — Internal monologue, character introspection  
  `[Street]` — Ground-level, ordinary citizen POV  
  `[Cosmic]` — Metaphysical, galactic, or non-human POV  
- If a scene blends modes, combine tags: `[Action][Street]`

Example:  
```
[Action]
The alarms pulsed red. Kora sprinted down the corridor, lungs burning.
```

---

## 3. **DIALOGUE FORMATTING**

- Use em dashes (—) in place of quotation marks for all spoken dialogue, lending urgency and intimacy.
- Indent or offset lines that are emotionally charged or pivotal, for emphasis.

Example:  
```
—We can’t hold them back any longer, Kaia.
    —We don’t have to. We just need to survive.
        Kora’s voice broke, trembling.  
        —I’m not sure I can do this.
```

- For internal monologue, use italics.

---

## 4. **KEY TERMS & SCI-FI CONCEPTS**

- On first use in each chapter, key terms are either *italicized* or **bolded** for emphasis (choose one for consistency).
- Examples:  
  —The *Cascade* was shifting.  
  —He reached for the **Shield of Unreason**.

- For recurring terms, only emphasize on first appearance per chapter or when introducing a new context.

---

## 5. **END-OF-CHAPTER HOOK**

- Each chapter must end with a bolded or italicized one-line hook, question, or haunting statement to pull the reader forward.
- Format:  
  ```
  ---
  *Was this the beginning of evolution, or the end of everything?*
  ```

- Place after final scene or paragraph, separated by a section break.

---

## 6. **CONSISTENT SECTION BREAKS**

- Use a visually distinct marker for all scene/POV shifts within a chapter.
  - Standard: `---`
  - For major shifts (e.g., from Earth to cosmic POV): `⧫⧫⧫`
- Always leave one blank line above and below the break for readability.

Example:  
```
[Reflection]
Kaia remembered the way the city smelled before the war.

---

[Action][Street]
Screams echoed from the plaza as the sky began to fracture.
```

---

## 7. **SENSORY CUES**

- Inline italics for direct physical or emotional sensations to heighten immersion.
- Examples:  
  —A chill *crawled* up her spine.  
  —His heart hammered, *panic* surging through every nerve.

- Use sparingly for maximum impact.

---

## 8. **GENERAL LAYOUT & ACCESSIBILITY**

- Leave one blank line between paragraphs for clarity, especially in digital formats.
- Use Markdown for all files, preserving italics, bold, and em dash conventions.
- For print/ebook conversion, ensure all tags and typographic choices translate cleanly.

## 9. **EXAMPLE PAGE**

```
# 3: THE GARDENERS' GAMBIT

[Cosmic]
The void sang around the Gardeners—an ancient, *hungry* melody.

[Action][Street]
—They’re here, Kaia whispered, as the first petals fell from the sky.

    —We have to warn the others. Now.
        Felix’s hands shook, a *cold dread* settling in his gut.

---

*What price will humanity pay for a second chance?*
```
