# THE NEURAL WARS: IMMERSION & IMPACT CHECKLIST (ABRIDGED)

---

## CORE METRICS

1. **Sensory Immersion:** 3+ senses per scene (touch, sound, smell).
2. **Concrete Grounding:** All cosmic/tech events have physical, human-scale effects.
3. **Emotional Punch:** Each scene has a clear emotional moment, shown not told.
4. **Language Vitality:** Prose is vivid, varied, and POV-specific.
5. **Character Authenticity:** Actions and reactions reveal unique personalities.

## ACTION BANK (FIXES)

- Add physical/sensory detail where abstract.
- Show emotional cost through body and behavior.
- Break exposition with action or conflict.
- Vary sentence length and metaphor.
- Anchor tech/power in lived experience.

## WORKFLOW

- Scene-by-scene: Audit → Sensory pass → Emotional pass → Language pass.
- Each chapter: Summarize arc, confirm hook, check immersion.

**Apply checklist to every scene and chapter for maximum reader engagement.**
