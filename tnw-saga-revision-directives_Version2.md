# THE NEURAL WARS: SAGA REVISION DIRECTIVES

## INTRODUCTION

This document distills all audit findings, style recommendations, and enhancement opportunities into a set of universal directives for revising The Neural Wars saga. These principles apply across all chapters and should guide every editorial decision throughout the revision process.

---

## I. CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGY & CONFLICT

### DIRECTIVE: DEEPEN INTERNAL STRUGGLES

**ALWAYS**:
- [ ] Give each POV character a clear internal conflict that contradicts their external goals
- [ ] Create specific moments where character values clash with practical necessities
- [ ] Show psychological evolution through physical reactions changing over time
- [ ] Include at least one vulnerability/breakdown moment per character arc
- [ ] Ensure decisions have emotional costs visible in physical manifestations

**NEVER**:
- [ ] Allow characters to reach major decisions without visible struggle
- [ ] Present internal monologues without physical/sensory grounding
- [ ] Resolve psychological conflicts too easily or without consequence
- [ ] Use the same emotional response pattern for different characters
- [ ] Tell the reader a character's feelings without showing physical evidence

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
1. For Mileo: Add moments where digital disconnection creates identity crisis
2. For Kora: Create instances where Cascade sensitivity conflicts with her need for control
3. For Sierra: Develop tension between tactical necessity and personal attachments
4. For all characters: Establish specific physical tells that reveal emotional states

### DIRECTIVE: INTENSIFY INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS

**ALWAYS**:
- [ ] Create specific points of friction between allied characters
- [ ] Show relationships evolving through concrete interactions, not exposition
- [ ] Include at least one unexpected alliance and one unexpected conflict per book
- [ ] Demonstrate trust-building through specific actions or revelations
- [ ] Allow conflicting viewpoints to remain unresolved when appropriate

**NEVER**:
- [ ] Present allies as consistently harmonious without tension
- [ ] Resolve interpersonal conflicts through simple conversations alone
- [ ] Use the same relationship dynamic across different character pairs
- [ ] Allow relationships to remain static throughout an arc
- [ ] Undermine established character traits for plot convenience

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
1. Create a relationship tension map showing evolution across chapters
2. Add specific scenes showing trust tested between key allies
3. Develop distinct conversational dynamics for each character pairing
4. Insert moments of unexpected support from antagonistic characters

---

## II. AGENCY & ENSEMBLE DYNAMICS

### DIRECTIVE: MAXIMIZE CHARACTER AGENCY

**ALWAYS**:

- [ ] Allow main characters to be passive observers for more than one scene
- [ ] Resolve major conflicts through convenient timing or coincidence
- [ ] Use the same decision-making pattern repeatedly for the same character
- [ ] Have characters act against established motivations without clear cause

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
1. Review each chapter climax to ensure it results from character choice
2. Create "agency moments" where characters act against advice/orders
3. Develop scenes where failures result from character decisions, not bad luck
4. Show ripple effects of key decisions affecting multiple characters

### DIRECTIVE: ENSURE ENSEMBLE DIVERSITY & DISSENT

**ALWAYS**:
- [ ] Include visible disagreement within any group/council scene
- [ ] Provide distinct perspectives based on character background and values
