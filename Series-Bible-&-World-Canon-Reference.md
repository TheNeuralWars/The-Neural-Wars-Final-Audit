## I. WORLD FOUNDATION & LOGIC

### Core Reality Structure

**The Three-Layer Existence Model**
- **Physical Layer**: Standard material reality where human bodies exist
- **Digital Layer**: The vast neural network connecting all Link-enhanced individuals
- **Cascade Layer**: Deeper quantum consciousness field accessible to evolved humans

*Canon Evidence*: "Mileo existed everywhere and nowhere. His consciousness stretched across Neo-Citania's neural network—tasting data streams, feeling the pulse of eight million connected minds, seeing through countless security feeds simultaneously."

**Universal Laws & Constants**
1. **Consciousness Conservation**: Mental energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed
2. **Link Degradation**: Extended neural interface use causes physical deterioration
3. **Cascade Resonance**: Evolved consciousness naturally seeks harmonic connection
4. **Control Entropy**: Authoritarian systems require increasing energy to maintain stability

### Geographic Canon

**Neo-Citania Structure**
- **Administrative Core**: Central district housing NeuroSys Tower and government facilities
- **Residential Districts**: Standardized living zones with mandatory Link compliance
- **Industrial Sectors**: Manufacturing and processing areas with heavy automation
- **The Slums**: Underground and peripheral areas with degraded Link coverage
- **Crimson Zones**: Areas of active resistance with intermittent Architect control

*Canon Evidence*: "The woman passed him without seeing—eyes glazed with the telltale blue tint of active Link compliance. The neural interface at her brainstem pulsed with each regulated thought, keeping her emotions within optimal parameters."

## III. TECHNOLOGY CANON

### The Link System

**Core Technology**
- **Neural Interface**: Physical implant at brainstem connecting to central network
- **Compliance Protocols**: Software controlling emotional and behavioral responses
- **Data Streams**: Constant information flow monitoring and influencing users
- **Collective Processing**: Shared computational power across networked minds

**Physical Manifestations**
- Blue-tinted eyes during active Link engagement
- Pulsing interface at brainstem during thought regulation
- Autonomic behavior modification without conscious awareness
- Memory access and modification capabilities

*Canon Evidence*: "The neural interface at her brainstem pulsed with each regulated thought, keeping her emotions within optimal parameters."

### Cascade Energy

**Core Properties**
- Quantum consciousness field accessible to evolved humans
- Enables direct consciousness-to-consciousness communication
- Can disrupt Architect control systems
- Requires significant mental discipline to channel safely

**Physical Effects**
- Blue-green energy manifestations
- Enhanced sensory perception
- Temporary expanded awareness
- Physical exhaustion after extended use

*Canon Evidence*: "The Cascade burned brighter behind her eyes. Stronger now. Too strong. If she couldn't control it soon, she'd become the weapon they wanted."

### Renaissance Protocol

**Function**: Advanced consciousness evolution technology
**Capabilities**: 
- Enables safe disconnection from Architect systems
- Facilitates controlled consciousness expansion
- Preserves individual identity during transformation
- Creates immunity to future authoritarian neural control

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Cascade-sensitive operators
- Quantum processing infrastructure
- Precise consciousness mapping
- Protective protocol barriers

*Canon Evidence*: "I can taste mathematics," she whispered. "The quantum field is like... like music made of light, and I'm both the composer and the note."

## IV. CULTURAL CANON

### Social Stratification

**Architect-Controlled Citizens**
- Complete Link compliance and optimization
- Emotional regulation within acceptable parameters
- Automatic reporting of anomalous behavior
- Limited awareness of pre-Architect existence

**Slum Dwellers**
- Partial or damaged Link connections
- Retention of emotional autonomy
- Underground economy and barter systems
- Oral tradition preserving pre-Architect culture

**The Fractured (Resistance)**
- Complete Link disconnection or immunity
- Preservation of individual consciousness
- Active opposition to Architect control
- Commitment to human freedom and choice

### Value Systems

**Architect Ideology**
- Optimization through compliance
- Collective efficiency over individual expression
- Elimination of emotional "disorders"
- Perfect social harmony through control

**Resistance Values**
- Choice as fundamental human right
- Individual consciousness as sacred
- Emotional authenticity over optimization
- Freedom despite personal cost

*Canon Evidence*: "And choice, Mileo now understood, was the only thing worth dying for."
